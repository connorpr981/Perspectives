If you wanted to become a super skilled practitioner there, what's the best career path? I don't know. Maybe it's to drop out and join SpaceX or something. I'm not necessarily endorsing pursuing the most establishment and credential oriented path. People should try to find the gradient of maximal learning in whatever it is they care most about. The question then is what that is. For biology, not that I'm a biologist, but it is very clear that in order to do really good work, there are a lot of \"bench\" skills one has to acquire and there is a lot of actual specific knowledge. Any kind of life wasn't designed with neat fundamental principles the way that maybe physics was. A lot of it is obviously evolved and contingent and messy and complicated and all the rest. So there is a lot of specific factual stuff to learn. For those two reasons, there are very few successful pure autodidacts in biology. In virtually every case that I'm aware of, at some point, you have to get direct experience in and with a top lab, where you're seeing how people actually do it in practice. This also ties back to what we were discussing previously: your question about the founders and what they learn from each other and so on. There's an interesting book, Apprentice to Genius, that follows three generations of scientists. So someone who mentored somebody else, who in turn mentored another scientist. And they're all extremely successful. The book is this description of what they all did, but also this reflection on: \"What is it that was transferred?\". For example, one of the most important and subtle questions in science is problem selection. How do you choose what to work on? No one tells you what to do. And you do have to answer this question multiple times. With a company, in some sense, you have to decide it once, and then it's an iterative process from there. Whereas in science, you're frequently pursuing completely new problems. You need to choose something that's sufficiently important and hard, so that it would be important if you succeeded, but it also mustn't be so complex that progress becomes unachievable. This is what mentees learn from their mentors according to the book. Another thing the book talks about is learning about high standards and what they actually are. When I talk to people in other domains, I hear very frequently, that when they worked with X person or Y organization or in Z environment, they learned what great actually is.

    "content": "Noah Smith and others have talked about, I can't remember the term he used, something like “moneyism”. He had a funny phrase. It pertains to the presumption that there is some constant elasticity between investment in some particular outcome, like building a semiconductor factory in Arizona or a new bridge, and the outcome of the factory or the bridge. First of all, the conversion rate between those inputs and the output is not a cosmological constant. Maybe any of these things could be done for half or a tenth of the cost. Secondly, there are even deeper questions as to, is it possible at all? What else would have to change for it to be possible? What are the other constraints? By talking about these things in funding and dollar terms, you're making the implicit assumption that the only relevant constraint is the financial one, where in practice, maybe it's permits or labor shortages or other things. In the context of the NIH and science and R&D, I'm really skeptical of this approach being brought to bear, where we can just talk about the amount that we're spending on R&D and think that that's implicitly a useful measure of the output. To a fairly close approximation, there were around 1% as many practicing professional scientists in the US pre-World War II as there were post-World War II or say even 1950. The other epiphenomena in papers or patents and so forth tend to follow pretty similar ratios. We got a lot of pretty good stuff in the first half of the century. Despite increasing the amount that we spend between two and maybe slightly more than two orders of magnitude it's not clear to me that there is a direct linear relationship between spending and output. When analyzing the NIH or how we should pursue any of this stuff, I try to get more concrete and tactile and think, what would success here look like? What is happening today at the microscale? What are the actual problems? What could success look like at the microscale? What might it look like to scale that up? One example of that, we ran a survey of the Fast Grants grant recipients after Fast Grants asking about their normal work, and not about anything to do with Fast Grants itself. We asked them if they had flexible funding, that is to say if they could direct their current research dollars however they wanted how much their associated research program would change. And we gave them three options: not much, a little, and a lot. Four out of five(79%) said that their research agenda would change a lot if this constraint was removed. Asking: \"Should the NIH funding level be X or 1.1X or 1.2X or whatever?\" seems to me like a bad way to analyze this question as compared to: \"How bound and constrained should an NIH grantee be in choosing their research agenda?\" Maybe their judgment is way better than that of the committees, not saying it is, but who knows? Maybe there's a 5X improvement to be generated just by making that one switch? I'm very skeptical of these financially-oriented frameworks."

The 1X then was a 1X of much higher quality, than 100X now. It's not clear what you do to fix that. If it's just a case, that there's a limited amount of John von Neumanns in your society, that are part of the pre-World War II 1X, it's not like we can just put 100X more John von Neumann-type physicists into science."

    "content": "Even though there are lots of scientists and lots of universities, there's a lot of homogeneity today in how science, and in particular, how biomedical science is pursued, where basic research is done in an academic context before there's any commercialization prospect in sight. I don't know that this model is necessarily a bad one. Certainly, we're not claiming that it's a bad one. Construct of universities, labs, PI — a principal investigator running the lab, who applies for grants primarily to the NIH, maybe supplemented by other sources, grants reviewed by committees with \"study sections\", as they call them, with pretty rigid scoring criteria and so on — that is the structure and it seems suboptimal to me. Homogeneity is bad in basically any ecosystem, especially ecosystems where you're producing or seeking tail outcomes. And we thought that, for a variety of reasons, from first principles, other models should be possible. We had specific ideas as to how one particular model might be a good idea and complementary to the status quo. In very short terms, what's different about Arc is: one, scientists are funded themselves to pursue whatever they want. So it's curiosity-driven research, whereas NIH grants are given for projects. Second, we build a lot of in-house infrastructure, so that scientists can draw upon other platforms and capabilities that they don't have to build and maintain themselves. Whereas, in the standard university academic context, scientists would virtually always have to do that in-house. Because of the natural scale constraints on any given lab, that effectively circumscribes the ambition of a possible research program. And thirdly, we try to provide career paths for people to remain in science if they don't want to become principal investigators, whereas the university structure commingles the training purpose of academia with the execution — the people who are doing the work there are typically the grad students and the postdocs, who are themselves, at least nominally, on the career path of eventually becoming principal investigators. There are lots of people who, for all sorts of different very valid reasons, love science and the pursuit of research, but don't want to be a manager running a lab, choosing their own research programs, and dealing with all of the overhead and typically grant applications that are concomitant with that. With Arc, we have a real emphasis on hiring scientists to finish their postdocs, finish grad school, who know that that's what they want to do in their lives. And again, it isn't really a career path for them today. One of the things that's really exciting about the discovery, that we mentioned, that came out yesterday, this new bridge editing technology, is: that work was led by one of senior scientists, who had finished his postdoc. It's not clear to me that he wanted to become a PI, but he loved science, and he's an amazing researcher, so he's able to go and have that career at Arc. In addition, the prospect of mobile elements being usable in this way for genomic insertion, whatever, — that's a pretty speculative, out there thing. Had he applied to the NIH to go and pursue that? He didn't, so I don't know what the outcome would have been. But Jennifer Doudna's work was, if I recall correctly, funded by DARPA, because her CRISPR NIH applications were rejected. Katalin Kariko's NIH applications for mRNA vaccine work were famously rejected. It at least seems very plausible that it wouldn't have worked out. All these things are random, and I can't make any definitive claims about what would have counterfactually happened. But it seems plausible to me that this thing announced yesterday wouldn't have happened or would have been less likely to happen in a different environment."

The meta-lesson here is: “Keep doing science.” With biotech, we don't have to go into specifics here, but are there specific things you can think of with this specific technology? You can imagine some nefarious things. How do you think about that? Why not focus, let's say, on ameliorating the risks first or something like that?"

My general view is: \"For most products and most businesses, things can just be done much better\". Moats are typically overrated. The payments are a great example of a domain where, on a logical basis, you would say that there are so many sources of defensibility: there's the network effects of the account holders, the data network effects/economy of scale for fraud, regulatory modes and barriers etc. etc. And yet, not only does Stripe exist, but there are lots of others. There's a whole fintech ecosystem today, right? It gets down to deep questions of: \"What is the binding constraint on the number of effective organizations that exist in the world?\" For any given sector, why is it that number of companies rather than twice that number of companies and so on? It's about motivation, ideas and people's willingness and determination to organize talent and so forth. But these are kinds of more sociocultural explanations. Hamilton Helmer is probably the leading scholar on various sources of defensibility for businesses. He has this niche, but very well known in the niche, book called Seven Powers.

    "content": "Yeah, the point about the misalignment over generations or over time is interesting. Do you have examples of institutions, which have for decades or centuries managed to keep their original, not only mission statement, but organizational competence? Because if you think of tech companies, even the oldest ones have not been around that long, right? And they're some of the biggest tech companies in the world. And the median age of the corporation is famously low. What is a good example here? **Patrick Collison** 00**:**50:48 Some of the explanations around the effects of shareholder capitalism suggest that it influences the incentives of organizations and their long term fates. Those theories have some credibility and it’s plausible that shareholder capitalism even attenuates the duration of some of these organizations. I'm not saying that's definitely true, but I find the idea that it could be, incredible. It's unclear if that's necessarily bad if it is true, right? In that, are we on the side of the humans, aggregate innovation in the world, or corporations, or quad legal entities? The answer isn’t clear to me. It should be the third. At the same time, if you look at Europe or places like Denmark, because of the tax code there, a lot of organizations are either controlled or substantially held by non-profit foundations. For example Novo Nordisk – the GLP company, Maersk – the shipping company, I believe also Lego. A lot of these corporations are controlled by foundations and usually have a lot of their stock held by them. In many cases that has the secondary effect, where they actually embed their mission into a legally binding constitution. I'm not an expert on Novo Nordisk, but I happened to get a book about it over Thanksgiving and there’s also a book on the Danish Industrial Foundations. It's enshrined in their constitution that they have to make insulin broadly available and really cheap or at least that is the case in Scandinavian countries. So it is allowed to charge market prices elsewhere but they're legally obligated to reinvest profits in R&D. Is that somehow causal in the fact that they made one of the most remarkable pharmacological discoveries of the last 20 years: GLP-1 agonists? – Plausibly. These questions of “Why is it that the median age of organizations and corporations is what it is?” are definitely interesting and I suspect the reason is somewhat dependent on the way we've chosen to organize large corporations in the US today."

It's not that we plan on doing it ourselves necessarily, but I'm wondering: \"Are there people we should share our technology with?\" Not even technology per se, but share our experience and try to help along. There's still a lot of stuff in the biomedical fields. Patents are pretty useful insofar as they go, but there's a lot of innovation that seems socially beneficial, that patents don't provide a way to cover the cost of. There was some excitement a few years ago about mannose, which is a sugar. There was one or maybe a few papers that suggest that maybe tumors will selectively take up mannose rather than glucose, but they won't actually metabolize it properly and they'll just die. Maybe this could be an effective onco-treatment. Mannose is like a generic sugar. It's been understood for more than a century and, importantly, you couldn't patent it. So it's not clear who has the incentive to even fund the work to test, whether or not this would actually work in practice. This is not an endorsement of mannose, but there are things of this shape, where there's something that clearly might be very beneficial, but it's not clear how the economic structure of the market can make it possible. There are still a lot of those across the biomedical landscape. There are still a lot of vaccines that could, in principle, exist that don't, like Lyme disease. There was one vaccine that was withdrawn from the market over safety concerns, that I think were misplaced, but there's still no vaccine."

    "content": "It's a good question. First a point on beauty with respect to architecture and then I'll answer that one. Just as a side note, it's interesting that API design in general doesn't get more study as a discipline and as a practice. It plays or can play a significant role in the fate of platforms. Not saying it is always the determinative thing. But if you get it right, there can be compounding positive benefits and the converse. It's really striking that, say with mobile app development, which was one of the most dynamic ecosystems of the past 10 or 15 years, so many of the objects and the classes, say in iOS development, are prefixed with NS. Less so now with Swift, but for much of the iPhone's history. The NS refers to Next app, back from Next in the 90s. When you get API design and architecture right, it can be so enduring over literally multiple decades, even in the face of what are otherwise frenzied evolutions in everything around it. Unix is another example of this. Yes, Unix has tons of shortcomings, but the architecture has worked now for more than half a century. We're all trying to impress upon people at Stripe the importance of multi-decadal abstractions. People sometimes respond to that thinking that that's some insanely lofty, implausibly ambitious hyperbola, but no, that's what happens, when you get this stuff right. In fact, if you get it right, people building on your platform can reap incredible benefits for a very long time. To the Mathematica point, I know they take backwards compatibility really seriously, to the point where you can run programs written 20 years ago, unchanged, in today's Mathematica. That really raises the stakes in API design for sort of obvious reasons. We have that problem ourselves, where, when we think about introducing something new, it's not just: \"Does this exigently address the particular need that's motivating it today?\" — but: \"Do we think we can stand behind this in 2044? How do we think the world might evolve around us, such that it all remains coherent?\" We certainly don't always get that right, but that's, on some level, what we're trying to do."

So there's paying for the actual credit issuance itself and then there's the customer support and all the ancillary things around the dispute handling and so forth. It is interesting to look at the cases where, for whatever contingent reason, the card networks didn't rise. Germany is one of the classic ones. From our vantage point, dealing with the online economy in Germany as compared to the US is so much worse. If Stripe could push a button and have really broadly adopted cards in Germany à la the US, we would push the hell out of that button. You can look at China, which on the one hand does have Alipay, WePay, WeChat payments, that are really ubiquitous — in that sense, they're very digitally enabled from a transactional standpoint. On the other hand, those products tend not to be as sophisticated with consumer credit. So yes, the transaction fees for transferring your money — that's super cheap, but you need to look at it on a fully loaded basis, where: \"OK, but what about the cost of actually getting the credit to make the purchase in the first place, as a credit card would enable?\" And as you look at these other counterfactuals in other places, one feels gratitude for what it is, that Dee Hock and Visa and MasterCard and the card networks made possible.

For some weird reasons hard to understand, once you layer in the customer support, consumer protection, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering controls and the credit, things seem to asymptote at around 2% or 3%. It's important to also note that beyond just covering the costs, much of it ends up getting remitted to consumers in the form of rewards, not in every country, but in many countries. If you look at the public reports from various banks in the US, their interchange revenue, where they're getting these delicious fees on every transaction, as you put it, a lot of that is going straight back out the door to the consumers. So it's not clear how exactly one should think about economics. If it's going back to the consumer, should you include that as a transaction tax or is it just like a weird circular relationship? I've not seen any evidence to suggest that the 2% or thereabouts is massively inefficient in the scheme of things. I'm not saying it's the optimal level— maybe 1% would be better, but within some range of 1% to 3%, it's probably reasonable. As we think about these ad valorem fees and figures, the place where there's even more change at the moment that we find ourselves thinking more about is the changing structure of global tax. There's been a reasonable amount of innovation in the tax domain over the last century: income taxes got pretty high, then we added value taxes, and so on. The new thing, at least in the online context, is jurisdictions remitting or imposing sales taxes on businesses that don't have any \"locus\" in the jurisdiction in question. So if you're a podcaster in the Bay Area, hypothetically \"Dwarkesh merch store\" will have to pay the town of Uppsala in Sweden, which will have a special tax on baseball caps. And you will need to know about that particular tax on baseball caps. And for any baseball caps that you are selling to the Uppsalians, you'll have to collect that amount from the buyer, report to Uppsala, and then eventually figure out how you're going to get that money to Uppsala. Obviously, it's this combinatorial problem of buyer jurisdictions and product types, and then all the different jurisdictions that you have to remit the money to. As to those amounts, we're not talking three basis points — the taxes in question are often 5% or 10%, so it's not trivial. As I think about the funds flows on the internet and how all that's evolving and unfolding, I think changes in tax law are actually a much bigger deal than anything about the transactional economics."

    "content": "Honestly, our problem ends up being that more things then we could possibly pursue, look like complements. In that every business almost by definition has revenue we obviously want to help them generate, accept, manage and orchestrate everything pertaining to that revenue. But once you're in that flow and you go through the steps of running a business, a lot else looks relevant and somehow connects quite directly. When Stripe started out, it definitely wasn't cool. It was the opposite, it was just a couple of us and we thought that we could make this superior payments API. For the vast majority of its history, Stripe has attracted people who are drawn to unglamorous infrastructure challenges and problems. We're not a company that specializes in making beautiful cars— we make roads. I bring all of that up, because it's relevant to this complement question, where in our discussions internally, a lot of it, probably the significant majority of it, is still about: \"OK, where are there practical shortcomings and limitations in even our core bread and butter?\" Payment processing might be a slightly too limited term to use for us. It's more about global programmable money orchestration, which, yes, is consumer to business payments, the sort that we were just discussing in, say, the context of your Substack. But it's also business to business payments, payments where there's credit or lending involved. It's also how you hold money, how you convert money between different currencies. It's how you represent money that's held by different legal entities and how we make it possible for even individuals or small businesses to act as micro multinationals. But those problems that we just skimmed over, even though they all directly pertain to the movement of money, they're not small. If we could just solve those really effectively, then Stripe will be a very consequential organization and force in the world. The counterfactual importance of building some of this stuff, as we go to newer markets that are, on a relative basis, more poorly served, is increasing rather than shrinking. In the US, there were payments companies before Stripe and maybe, if Stripe had never done its thing, eventually you'd have found some way to monetize a newsletter or something like that. But if you're in Albania, the set of options available to you is far more restricted. The marginal impact as we expand globally increases quite a bit.

    "content": "This is one of the things we've spent the most time on. Back to this point about wanting to be the place with the best people and the value of focusing on craft, so that you can have the best people. In the context of software development, two things developers hate: slow development cycles: it'll ship in the next release in a month and that kind of thinking. Developers also hate being paged at 2 AM for incidents. So, given the criticality of the businesses that we serve, which is, in rough terms, 1% of the global economy — it's not totally clear how to measure this, because GDP is defined as final goods and Stripe is not only selling final goods, so, in theory, there could be a bit of double counting. But Stripe is mostly selling final goods. We're not used, by and large, for giant supply chain shipments. Maybe there's a mismeasurement of 10% or 20% or something. But long story short, I think it works out to about 1% of global GDP. It's about a trillion dollars a year. As you say, that then makes us really terrified of outages. And so we work so hard to enable fast iteration and development cycles without having outages, and to put some numbers on it: we deploy production services that are in the core charge flow around 1,000 times a day. Most of these services are automatically deployed, so when anybody makes any production-ready change, it just goes into production. It's meticulously and carefully orchestrated: first is just running some small sliver of traffic and then incrementally more traffic until it's everything. So about 1,000 deploys per day at roughly or somewhat in excess of five-and-a-half-nines — 99.9995% reliability — which works out to about two, two and a half minutes of unavailability per year. It's not that we have, obviously, two and a half continuous minutes of unavailability, but that's what it approximates to, even though it tends to happen as background radiation throughout the year. Getting to that point takes a huge amount of investment. Then there are security properties that are less readily measured, but analogous to those figures. Silicon Valley doesn't tend to... I'm perhaps now being unfair in attributing things to Silicon Valley — a lot of the tech industry doesn't place a lot of value on process and operational excellence. We culturally value the spontaneous, the creative, the iconoclastic, the path-breaking. Building mechanisms that can enable the very reliable provision of important services at scale, and removing the sources of variability, that can really cause a bad day for a very large number of people — I don't think these things get quite as much cultural credit. None of this sounds like rocket science, but defining what it is, that we care about, and then building automated measuring systems to measure to what degree it's happening in practice, to then try to figure out the cases where we're not living up to that, and determine what is the reason, then to actually intervene and improve the system, so that that's not happening, then importantly, to build secondary controls, that detect instances of deviation long before they cause a production problem, but where we understand the behavior of the system in sufficient detail, so that we can instrument it in some upstream way — most of what I said there was well understood by production engineers in 1930s.

At some point, those have to converge for obvious mathematical reasons. But we're 14 years in and they haven't converged yet. There's a lot of headroom there. Say Stripe is handling around a trillion dollars a year. When Stripe started out, the global economy was sixty to seventy trillion-ish. The global economy is now around a hundred trillion. We still have quite a bit of headroom before the amount of activity that is coming out to Stripe is really butting up against the ceiling of global economic growth. And of course, there's no ceiling on global economic growth for all sorts of reasons. It could be vastly higher than it is. And I don't even mean new technologies or AIs, but just all the basic per-capita math you can do around. What if everybody had an income on par with the US? One of the reasons I am so interested in working on Stripe is: it's the old line, the Lucas line, about how when you start thinking about differential rates of development in countries, it's hard to think about anything else. Why does Brazil have the particular income and GDP level that it does? Why does Poland have the level that it does? Why did Ireland have the trajectory that it did, where it went from being the sick man of Europe to now one of the wealthiest countries there? I feel like Stripe is some applied version of this question in practice, where you're building software products, but in some sense connected to or touching upon these questions of: Why aren't there more companies? What determines the growth rate of a company? Why is it that when you start the merch store, why does it have X level of buyers rather than 2X? I think those remain fruitful questions. We haven't optimized the meta system of business to any particularly great extent. For the vast majority of time, businesses have been offline, inefficient, analog. It's really only over the last one to two decades that a significant share of this has been meaningfully digitized. And the prospects for optimizations there are still significantly underexplored.

So I think it'll be many decades before that happens. But it's true: that will eventually occur. On the second question: \"It's obviously virtuous or compelling or exciting to foster all these nascent startups and to be an anti-incumbency force. But what's the case for supporting established businesses?\" People misunderstand that for a small business, typically, at least in the cases where we denote them startups, there's usually an embedded innovation. And this innovation is all that the company is. They have a new idea, and they're going to do something better or different etc. Generally speaking, we like innovation and so we have positive sentiments towards that startup. But there's a lot of innovation that comes from large established businesses. That's not all they do, they are also just running the existing thing. So maybe it's a smaller share, but the aggregate fraction of innovation that comes from established businesses is really large. We have to be cognizant of the cognitive bias, of the startups being more conspicuous. On a relative basis, the improvements in turbine, fab or insulation technology come largely from established businesses. To choose any sector of the economy, a significant fraction of the important inventions that occurred over the last 10 or 20 years will have come from the incumbents. As a general class, and Tyler wrote a book on this, big business is underrated. If you look at the survey data, people tend to have very positive sentiments not only towards startups, but towards small business as a class. Even though they have negative sentiments or relatively negative sentiments towards big business, it is not that bad on an absolute basis, but not as favorable. It's true that established businesses tend to pay better, tend to be more efficient, more of the innovation in our economy comes from them and they produce a lot of consumer surplus. The specific case for Stripe working with them is: typically they're coming to us not because they want to take the thing that they're already doing and go through all the work of transposing to Stripe, but because either they want to do a new thing, that they're not doing today — so it is associated with some new business line or innovation or invention.
