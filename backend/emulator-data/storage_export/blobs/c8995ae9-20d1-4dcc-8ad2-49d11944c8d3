There's been a lot of controversy after COVID about people pointing fingers about masks or different protocols. Why was this not a bigger issue?

    "content": "Oh, goodness. This was different in different places. Confusingly, different places in the United States use the same names for these tiers for different people. In the state of California, Tier 1A comes before 1B comes before 1C comes before Tier 2, et cetera. 1A changed over time on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis, sometimes in mutually incompatible ways at the same time. It was an entire mess. At the start, Tier 1A was for healthcare professionals, a few others, and people above the age of 75. No wait, we'll change that to 65. Tier 1B was where we put a few favored occupational groups and some other folks. Tier 1C was for people who doctors think will probably die if they contract COVID unvaccinated, but who have not appeared in group 1A or 1B yet. Who got 1A? Healthcare professionals, like doctors administering the vaccine. That sounds pretty reasonable. Also, veterinarians. Were veterinarians urgently required by society at the time? Not so much. It was because the California Veterinarians Association is good at lobbying. That isn't just me alleging that. They sent a letter out to their membership saying, \"we are so good at lobbying, we got you guys into 1A. Congrats and go get your vaccine now.\" I have that on my website. Tier 1B. School teachers were classified as Tier 1B. Why? Go figure.Teachers’ unions have political power in the state of California. They said, “we'll accept not being in 1A, but we are going no lower than 1B.” Probably no one in that meeting ever said, \"I definitely think that 25-year-old teachers who are currently under stay-at-home orders should be in front of people who will die if they get COVID.\" But we made that choice."

Israel adopted the policy that if shots were expiring, they'd forget the tiering system and anything else. They'd literally walk out into the street and say, \"I've got the COVID shot. I need to administer it in the next 15 minutes. Who wants it?\" In the United States, we had a policy ban on doing that. We said no. To protect the integrity of the tiering system and embrace our glorious cause of health equity, you should throw that shot out. This policy was stupid and it was announced by governors proudly in December in front of news cameras. A couple of weeks later, reality set in. People told them, \"sir, it turns out that throwing out the vaccine is stupid.\" The governor didn't go on the nightly news again to say, \"I gave a very confident policy speech a month ago in front of this news camera. I said that I would prosecute anyone who gives out end-of-day shots—”"

    "content": "Again, trillions of dollars are on the line. The United States is spending tens of billions of dollars or more on its COVID response strategy. The true biggest issue is why has it come down to Patrick McKenzie's ability to fundraise in the tech industry for us to have a system here? Bracketing that, the tech industry underperformed my expectations for what it should have accomplished here. There were some bright spots and less bright spots with regards to the fundraising project. For those of you who don't know, the total budget of this project was $1.2 million. It’s not quite couch cushion money, but it’s not large relative to the total amount of resources that the tech industry can deploy on problems. I looked at my email this morning to refresh my memory. I'm not going to name people, but they're welcome to claim credit if they want to claim credit. I emailed the CEO at a particular company, \"hey, I saw you like to tweet about this on Twitter. I'm essentially raising a seed round except for a 501(c)(3) charity/(3/)_organization) and we urgently need money for this. Here's a two page memo.\" I sent that email at 4:30 p.m. California time. He got back to me. There were some internal emails routed to this person and then to that person. “Hey run that by blah, blah, blah.” 9:30 the next morning, he said, \"I'm personally in for $100,000 out of my own pocket. My banker is going to contact you.” The wire cleared the same day. So yay for that. On the less yay side, tech is not exactly a stranger to having bureaucracies. In some cases, it was a matter of \"oh indicatively, we want to support that, but we have a process\" and that process went on for six weeks. By the time six weeks was over, it was May. By May, most people in the professional managerial class who had prioritized getting a vaccine for themselves and their loved ones had succeeded at that. They said, \"okay, the vaccination supply problem is pretty much solved, right?\" I'm like, “no, it is not solved right now.” It is solved for the people who are smartest about working the system in a way it was not solved for even them back in January. But there are many people who are not yet vaccinated. They’d say, \"that's a vaccine hesitancy issue.\" No, it is not merely a vaccine hesitancy issue. It is still the case that there are logistical problems. It is still the case that people don't know that you can just Google the vaccine now. It is still the case that around the edges of the American medical system, in places that are underserved, people don't have it or they can't get transportation, etc. You should continue funding this team for the next couple of months so that we can do what we can around the edges here. Again, people can do what they want with their own money. I understand that charitable funders have many things. I was told, “relative to the other places we can put money to work in the world, further investment in the American vaccine supply situation as of May and looking forward, it doesn't make sense for us. Could you do it in another nation?” We said, “okay, we're the American effort. We have some advantages here. We would not have them in another nation. We did talk to people there. We tried to see if we could help a team there or go there, etc. But we don't see that there's a path to positively impacting the problem there in a way that there's manifestly a path to positive impact here.” We lost that argument. We didn't get the money. The last $100K in was my daughter's college education fund."

And two, this is a true answer, I'm a flawed human who has a limited number of cycles in his day. I was running a very complex operation. It literally didn't occur to me, “hey, maybe those people that have been making a lot of noise about writing a lot of money for pandemic checks would be willing to write a pandemic check.” That was not entirely an irrational belief for me because I had reached out to people who are making a lot of noise about writing money for pandemic checks. They said, \"not in the United States, not in May.\" I thought, “oh, if I light up a conversation totally cold with someone now, it's likely to just get a no again.” I should try to scrimp and save and break the piggy bank for my daughter's college education fund. By the way, she'll go to college folks, no worries. But it's how far down the list of Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C. We were down to Plan C at that point."

    "content": "Discounting to zero is the opposite of wisdom here because we didn't accomplish zero. We accomplished an extremely impressive thing in aggregate. It vastly underperformed the true thing that we were capable of. You have to keep both parts of the equation in our minds at the same time. People in tech need to become radically more skilled at interfacing with government. To the extent that we have some manifest competency issues in government right now, we can't simply sit out here and gripe about this on podcasts, etc. We've got to go out and do something about it. I think it's been reported that there was a meeting among tech leaders early in the vaccination effort where a bunch of people got in a room and were like, \"this is going terribly. I hope someone fixes it.\" \"I hope someone fixes it\" is no longer a realistic alternative. We have to be part of the solution. It's partly about having higher fidelity models for how Washington works than simply, \"oh, they're bad at everything.\" It is important to understand that the government has some manifest competence issues. It's also important when working with the government to understand that telling the government to its face, \"you have manifest competence issues\" is not the maximally effective way to keep getting invited to the meetings. I was very religious about not criticizing anything about this Californian response effort in 2021 because we needed to be in the room where it happens. That was a choice made. Am I 100% happy with that choice? No, but we kept some relationships that we really needed. I'm not saying don't criticize the government, obviously. Be strategic about that sort of thing. Play like you are attempting to win the game. On the government side, one thing we need is dispelling the massive “ugh” field that surrounds software. This is going to be a part of the future, whether you like it or not. We need to get good at it. We can no longer accept incompetence at this as the routine standard of practice in Washington. Secondly, it is enormously to the United States’ credit that we have an extremely functional, capable tech industry. Maybe we shouldn't treat it like the enemy. I’m just putting that out there. Again, this is a thing the United States has done before. There are laws in place. There are decades of practice. We could put a colonel's uniform on somebody. Think seriously about doing that next time. Do I think we have institutionally absorbed all the correct lessons from this? No. When I see after action reports, they praise a lot of the things that people think are very important for maintaining their political coalition. These are things which were either not productive or anti-productive. They fail to identify things that were the true issues. To the extent that they identify things that were the true issues, the recommended action is, \"I hope someone fixes this next time.\" That’s no longer sufficient, that the default case is that the ball will be dropped. Those of us who were involved in VaccinateCA kind of dread what we call the Bat-Signal. God willing, there will not be another worldwide pandemic killing millions of people as long as we live. If there is one, we know what numbers to text to get the band back together. Society should not rely on us as Plan A. How did this happen?"

    "content": "I have two broad perspectives on this. People often treat the market cap of something as implicitly like some sort of cost on society. The true cost of crypto on society has been this. Anytime one engages in attempting to do productive enterprise, some actor in society has said, “okay, I will stake you with some of society's resources. These resources are rivalrous). They cannot be applied to any other things society needs. I do this in the hope that you will produce something that is worthy of being staked with this.” How much have we spent on crypto? Not on trading tokens around, but I mean building infrastructure and spending rivalrous resources that we can't get back. There’s GPUs or ASICs or electricity that could have gone to other things in China, but went into mining. There’s the time of talented and intelligent people that could have been building other software products but were instead building crypto. That number is in the tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars. What do we have to show for that tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars? I am very crypto skeptical and I could give you an answer to that question. Crypto fans would not like to hear it from me. So I prefer Vitalik Buterin's articulation of this question from 2017. At the time it was $0.5 trillion, a trivial number only $500 billion. He asked, and I'm paraphrasing, \"have we truly earned this number? How many of the unbanked have we actually banked? How many distributed applications have a meaningful amount of value doing something which is meaningful?\" He has about six other meditations on this. Crypto folks certainly aren't accountable to me. In some manner, you're not even accountable to Vitalik even though he's clearly a leading intellectual in the community. You're accountable to producing positive value in the world. What is the answer to Vitalik in 2024? How many of the unbanked have we truly banked? What is the best use case for crypto right now? Once crypto has a responsive answer that is sized anything like proportionate to the hundreds of billions of dollars resources that we've staked crypto with, then crypto people should feel enormously proud of that accomplishment. In some future where that hypothetically arrives, you have my sword. I will love your initiative. However, for the last many years we have been saying you can still get in early. You can still get in early because the value has not arrived yet. That is my capsule summary on crypto 14 years in. We've staked a group of talented people who are very good at giving a sales pitch, with tens or hundreds of billions of dollars and look at what we have built. This would be a failure in any other tech company, a capital-F failure. Either radically pivot and unfail it or maybe we should stop continuing to stake you with money."

It is descriptively accurate that the banking system — and all companies which are necessarily tightly tied to the banking system, which might be all companies — are a policy arm of the government… Whether people articulate that in exactly those words or not varies a little bit, but when you have your mandatory compliance training you'll be told in no uncertain terms that you are a policy arm of the government. I feel for crypto folks that say that this feels like warrantless search and seizures of people's information in a very undirected dragnet) fashion. I have somewhat complicated thoughts about this. The modern edifice of KYC and AML dates back to the Bank Secrecy Act in the United States, which was in late 1970s. At the time, the US federal government was strictly rate limited in how much attention it could give to KYC and AML. Maybe because we thought we had very limited state capacity at the time, the government would make rational decisions and go after $10-100 million enormous white collar crooks and drug trafficking cartels a year. It would not surveil down to literally everyone in society. However, the regulations we wrote and have continued to tighten over the years do effectively ask for transaction-level surveillance of every transaction that goes through a bank. This is the actual practice. This is not a conspiracy theory. I'm making nothing up, folks. The actual practice in banks is that they have about as many intelligence analysts as the American intelligence community has. They get this scrolling feed of alerts generated by automated systems. For each alert, they go, “don't worry, don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t worry…” for millions of these alerts every day. Then for some tiny percentage, they say, “oh dear, this one might actually have been a problem. I'm going to write a two to four page memo and file it with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.” In all probability, no one is ever actually going to read that memo. We have an intelligence community-sized operation running in banks to write memos that no one ever reads. Some tiny portion of those memos will be useful to law enforcement in the future. If you had explained that trade in a presidential debate in the 1980s, I find it extremely unlikely that any part of the American polity would want to buy that. Could we perhaps spend tens of billions of dollars on it? But we did that. To that extent I'm extremely copacetic with crypto folks on this. Point. A: This thing factually exists in the world. I agree with you that it does. Point B: In an ideal world, this thing would not exist. I agree with you, there are very real privacy fears. However, crypto has this habit. People who are good at sales have various sales pitches that they give to people. Actors within the crypto ecosystem will talk an excellent game about privacy as long as “number go up.” When you have to choose between being tied into the banking system — which is necessary for number go up — or you can choose privacy, they will say, “excellent, I choose number go up.”"

    "content": "I don't accept that it is the only thing possible for us. I don't accept that the United States is incapable of doing nice things. We can't accept that. We have to be optimistic about the future. Otherwise, what are we doing here? In the tech industry, we know it is not a physical law of reality or of large institutions that one cannot make systems that work. Making systems that work is the job. We have a few existence proofs. We should increase our engagement with government. Hey state capacity, we can help you build some of that stuff. Also, the Constitution of the United States is a document we feel attached to. Again, incentives rule everything around us. In early 2021, the tech industry was very concerned about being told in no uncertain way by people in power, \"if you embarrass us, we'll end you.\" One thing in the judicial record of this case is that the White House and other government actors routinely overreached and asked the tech companies, \"we would like you to censor this and this and this.\" The tech companies said no in a bunch of cases. It’s important to continue to negotiate for the right outcome rather than the one that people in power merely want. There are some things that will feel unfortunate and maybe a little bit outside of our true sweet spot of what we would want to be doing on a Tuesday in tech. Maybe we have to ratchet up the amount of public policy advocacy that we do. Lobbying is a dirty word in the tech industry. It probably shouldn't be. When the \"do not embarrass us\" order came down, people were getting very quiet about the fact of feeling constrained by this. Maybe we should have spoken out more and spoken more boldly about it. It was the routine case that the White House was telling Facebook, Twitter, etc. to censor on a tweet by tweet, communication by communication basis. This is also with regards to broad rules that affected the residents of the United States and also everyone else in the world. These are the operating systems of the world. They were giving direct orders on, \"there's a certain kind of speech act which we find vexatious and we would like you to stop that everywhere.\" Very plausibly, we should get on the nightly news and say, \"I received the following email from the White House that says we should stop this everywhere.” If you point a gun at me, I will comply with this at the point of a gun. That is what it will take."

    "content": "I have an enthusiasm for the minutiae of banking procedure in a way that few people do. Sometimes banking procedure causes physically observable facts to emanate into the world. If you know that those facts are going to emanate, then you can have a claim made about a past state of the world. I did this thing. I did not do this thing. If true, that claim will cause metadata in other places and you can look for the metadata. This is actually how a lot of frauds are discovered. Basically the definition of fraud is that you're telling someone a story. The story alleges a fact about the world. The story is not true and you're using the story to extract value from them. Most frauds will allege facts about the physical world. As the physical world gets more and more mediated by computers, it gets increasingly sharded) between different institutions. There will often be institutions that are not under control of the fraudster and have information available to them, which will very dispositively answer the question of whether the alleged fact happened or not. As a reporter, it’s important to understand how institutions and society interact with each other. It’s important to understand the physical reality of how if this thing happens as alleged, then these papers will be filed, then these API calls will be made, etc. Then doing the core job of reporting involves finding people at the institutions who will tell you the truth. As an example of this, many years ago [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) was insolvent. That fact was widely rumored but not reported, presumably because the global financial news industry didn't find it convenient to have someone call into the Japanese banking system and ask the right questions in the right way. The CEO of Mt. Gox alleged on BitcoinTalk that the reason they were not able to make outgoing wires was because they had caused a distributed denial of service attack on their bank's ability to send foreign currency wires. That bank was Mizuho. Mizuho was the second largest bank in Japan. Many people at well-regarded financial reporting institutions in New York City find it incredibly exotic and difficult — and maybe in some ways unknowable — to extract facts from Mizuho. There are addresses. FedEx will deliver letters to them. They have phone lines. We also have fax machines. We love our fax machines. Could you send a fax to anybody at Mizuho and say, \"hey, quick question, are you sending wires today?\" Mizuho would receive the fax, look at it quizzically, and say, \"in response to your fax earlier, yes, we are still sending wires because we are the second largest bank in Japan. Do you have any other easy to answer questions for us?\" Financial reporting dropped the ball on asking Mizuho simple questions about reality. Maybe you should do that next time. The CEO is giving out gold on BitcoinTalk under his own name. These are obviously reportable statements. The statements are alleged facts about material reality. Maybe chase down the truth value of that. That's hard. It's so much easier to just repeat what he says on Twitter and say, \"as said by this person on Twitter,\" and then quote the Bitcoin price feed. But reporting is hard. Be good at it."

Could I have you get some yen and wire that to me in America and you can take a percentage?\" I really don't like where this is going. They said, \"there's this company and I've got some money over there. They can send yen, but they can't send dollars.\" Is that because they don't actually have the money? They're like, \"no, it's a Japanese banking thing.\" Okay, no it's not. Japanese banks are very good at sending wires. They said, \"no, it's really this thing. This is totally clean. You would not be having this conversation with me if it was totally clean. You need a money launderer. I will not be your money launderer."

    "content": "It's not merely a matter of getting them to look the other way. Go back to the original SBF interviews where he's telling the founding myth of Alameda. He says very loudly that the reason why he got this opportunity to do bitcoin arbitrage between Japan and the United States is because he was able to do something that the rest of the world wasn't. He doesn't say this in these many words. I will say it. He suborned a Japanese bank. You need that as one of the pieces to run this arb and then he pulled tens of millions of dollars out of this. I don't think people really listened to what he was saying there. He literally says in the interview on Bloomberg, \"if I was a compliance person, this would look like the sketchiest thing in the world. This looks like it's obviously money laundering.\" Because it is money laundering. Interestingly, Michael Lewis retells the story and locates the story in South Korea rather than in Japan. Some people who were involved say they tried it in South Korea and Japan. I wish people would pull on more threads there. There's still lots of that story that we don't know. Anyhow, how sophisticated do you have to be to launder tens of billions of dollars? SBF did that. That is a bar for sophistication. He was eventually caught. He was not caught for laundering tens of billions of dollars. He wasn't even under suspicion for laundering tens of billions of dollars around. SBF was Tether)'s banker. Alameda Research — one of the parts of the corporate shell game they were playing — moved tens of billions of dollars of cash around the financial system. It did so largely under full color of law on behalf of Tether. It moved it from wherever Tether or their customers had it to, at the moment, I think it's mostly at Cantor Fitzgerald. Some shoe has to drop there eventually. I will eat a lot of popcorn when it does. Be that as it may. There's many other ways to launder money. Let's say I establish a shell corporation and I buy a piece of real estate in New York City. I rent that real estate out to people. I collect a stream of rents from that. That money looks clean because there is an excellent business. It's my shell corporation that is renting this real estate that really exists, to a totally legitimate person. This money is clean. The money that I put into the system to buy this on behalf of the shell corporation, I'm just going to wire it to a lawyer. The lawyer is going to answer any question from the bank with, \"I don't know where it came from. I don't have to tell you. I'm a lawyer. It's a real estate transaction. What do you want from me?\" In one sense, that's money laundering if the original money was the proceeds of crime. In another sense, that's how every real estate transaction goes down at those scales. Often a facility at money laundering is just a facility at operating the economy, plus willingness to do that to hide the proceeds of some other crime. I would be really good at money laundering. I'm glad I haven't done it professionally. It's fascinating intellectually. Previous communications departments I've worked at probably explicitly anti-endorse that sentiment. What can one do?"

    "content": "Interestingly, this is one of those places where culture is not merely a term but actually descriptive in some ways. It gets contentious so I don’t want to point fingers at particular examples. There are some cultures in the world that have institutionally adopted more of a pro-capitalist, pro-mercantilist ethos. They have less of an ingrained skepticism regarding earning money and accumulating resources as a goal. There are other cultures which have an extremely ingrained skepticism about earning money and accumulating resources as a plausible goal. Those cultures generate people who have very different negotiation strategies. When you impact people with different negotiation strategies against the reality of a well-operated organization like Google for example, they arrive at very different numbers. Is it Amy Chua who wrote [a book about “market-dominant minorities? \"](https://amzn.to/4dcVHKN) All people are equal in the eyes of God and hopefully in the eyes of the law. Not all cultures physically make the same decisions with regards to the same facts on the ground. That causes some disparity in outcomes. That is one tiny part of that thesis. I've read a lot of books. I don't necessarily endorse every word in every book that I read. However, there is something to that. Another thing is that there's a certain personality-type cluster of people that got into tech. It is over-advanced that the tech industry and the pathologies of the tech industry are caused by the nerd vs. jock distinction in American high schools, heavily over-advanced. What’s the amount of truth to that? Not zero. Many of us came up feeling we were largely getting beaten down by the system around us. We were not worthy, etc. Then we carry those issues into our professional lives. Some people work their way out of it quickly. Some do not. For class and other reasons, some people go to institutions like Stanford and hear from… I don't know who you hear things from if you go to Stanford. I certainly didn't go there. Let’s say it’s an elder fraternity brother that says, \"yo bro, this is the way the world works. You really got to negotiate when you get an offer in your discussion with Google. I've talked to so many brothers and they don't negotiate. The ones that do make a whole lot more money.\" You're like, “wow, good for that.\" Most people don't get that talk from their elder fraternity brother because they do not go to Stanford and don't have an elder fraternity brother.

    "content": "Yes. I love many things Byrne writes. I think I luckily have a differentiated point of view on this one. I hope to get it out to the internet someday. On the one hand I loved it. The Factorio space exploration mod specifically was the best video game I ever played. Yet I spent 750 hours on that over the course of a year. I was on sabbatical and recharging from six very hard charging years at Stripe and also running the United States vaccine location information effort. But there's a question of, at relevant margins are you maximizing for your true values? I was a little worried about that. Now my EA checks on me. Do I worry about it for other people? When I was young and a World of Warcraft raid guild leader who spent a thousand hours on that, it was a substitute advancement ladder for me. The actual job I was working, selling around central Japan, gave me no scope of control over things. I thought if I were a startup CEO, I could make decisions right now. I could build something awesome, but I don't have that ability. I don't see myself as being the kind of person who could become a startup CEO. If I can't be satisfied with my nine-to-five job in terms of making things happen in the world, at the very least I can do this. Make sure we kill the dragon in two hours. Guys, don't stand in the fire. Come on, team leaders, you need to make sure that people are equipped with the resist gear before they get there. We're having internal spats about allocation of resources. We need to have a better DKP system. By the way, World of Warcraft raid guilds — and all other places where intellectual effort comes together in the video game community — are much more sophisticated than people give them credit for. When I started VaccinateCA, I told people my sole prior leadership experience was having 60 direct reports in a raid guild. That's true. I don't want to rat hole on the subject, but there are parts of VaccinateCA that are very definitely downstream of the intellectual efforts involved in managing raid guilds specifically. There were multiple people internally who were like, “yep, we are running the raid guild playbook right now.” Be that as it may, you can do something with your life. Choose to do something with your life. Then if you want to play a reasonable amount of video games, then play a reasonable amount of video games. With respect to individual people, I've struggled with depression at some points in my life. Many people struggle with under-diagnosed, under-treated depression. Sometimes you get into a self-destructive spiral measured against your true values and preferences. Due to depression and other factors, you aren't making as much progress on the true goals. You use video games as an escape from that. It’s not just video games but books, television, etc. There are many poisons available. You pick your poison and use that to escape. The amount of effort you put into the poison causes you to have less effort available to do the true thing. So you get worse results at the true thing. Helping people out of those self-destructive spirals is something that we as a society could stand to get much better at."

    "content": "Interestingly, I was a marketing engineer earlier in my career and really thought that was important. In terms of high-level advice, I'd probably tell a founder a bit about marketing engineering. I wouldn't spend 95% of my time on it unless that was explicitly why they brought me in. What do founders spend too much time on? Playing house and chasing status are two well-known pitfalls. Your incentives will draw you into playing the role of a successful CEO before your actions have earned the company its level of success. The fundamental nature of early-stage businesses is that investment in you is not an indication of what you have achieved. It’s an advance on your future accomplishments. You need to rigorously pursue actually making those future accomplishments. There are many ways to pursue this. Talk to more users, write more software, make something excellent, get more people to use it, get better at selling it, etc. This is an important strain of Silicon Valley culture. I'm glad we have it and we're popularizing it worldwide, including to me in central Japan. Yet there are always other games going on. Those games are less important but very attractive. Not video games, but things like attending conferences, meeting interesting people, or going to the best parties. Showing up at the best parties does not, at most margins, increase the number of users you talk to. It doesn't write functioning code. Do the things that actually matter. Some distractions proudly wave, \"I'm a distraction from everything that matters.\" Some don’t. Others feel like real work but are not. Don't do the things that don't matter.
